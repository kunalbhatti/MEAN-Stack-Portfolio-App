Technoloy Used: MEAN Stack + Ionic Framework. 
Deployment: Heroku

Inspiration behind the project:

I wanted to build a platform for displaying my development projects.

Features Added:

Manage Projects:
The app allows me to create, edit and delete projects. Each project can display information like name, technology used,short description, Github link and preview link. In addition to this each project can have a thumbnail and a video explaining about the project. The videos are uploaded to the server and are directly streamed from the server. 

Messaging System:
I've added an option for the visitors to contact me directly by sending me a message. Once the message is sent, I can view and reply back directly from the app itself. The app uses Sendgrid API for the purpose for mailing.


I never used the this app, because Heroku uses dynos which resets after some time and thus deleting all assets uploaded. The app can be used on a platform that gives storage options along with Node hosting.
